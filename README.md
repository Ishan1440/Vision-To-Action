* A Python environment with the required libraries (streamlit, google-generativeai, dotenv).

**Installation**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.env` file and add your Google API key as the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable.
4. Replace the placeholder project ID in the code with your actual project ID.

**Usage**
1. Run the Python script.
2. Enter your project idea and select the desired project type and technologies.
3. Click the "Generate Project BluePrint" button.
4. The generated blueprint will be displayed in the "BluePrint" tab.

**Key Features**
